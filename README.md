Unit 1 Project Build an About Me Site

I relied heavily on HTML and CSS for this site, with some jQuery to make the website more interactive and functional. I started out drawing a mockup of what I thought the website would look like, and then researched ways to make it possible. It turned out that a lot of what I wanted to do could be achieved through simple CSS, so I focused on solidifying the aesthetics of the site before getting the functionality down.

Javascript is not a strong suit of mine at this point, but I was able to figure out the testimonials timer and the nav bar buttons functions, so those were big accomplishments for me.

The hamburger nav bar turned out to be pretty tricky, and I still need to work on the formatting. It just doesn't look good, but at least it's functional. I would like to spend more time trying to work those issues out.
